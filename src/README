To register a new client
------------------------

Make a config.cfg file like:

cc=39
phone=391234567890  # phone including country code
id=1234567          # some random number (not important)

Get the registration code by sms:

./yowsup-cli -c config.cfg --requestcode sms

Read the request code in the sms sent by whatsapp and confirm the registration:

./yowsup-cli -c config.cfg --register 123-456

In the answer read the password in the line:

pw: I/ijKHt+0klXTrJ97g0PqPlJ3/s=

and add it in the config file:


cc=39
phone=391234567890  # phone including country code
id=1234567          # some random number (not important)
password=I/ijKHt+0klXTrJ97g0PqPlJ3/s=

Then, to send a message:

./yowsup-cli -c config.cfg -s 399876543210 "Some message!"
